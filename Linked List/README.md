A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in a sequence of nodes. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size, and memory allocation is done dynamically. Each node in a linked list contains two parts:

1. **Data**: This is the actual value or data that the node holds. It can be of any data type depending on the implementation requirements.
2. **Pointer to the next node**: This is a reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence. It allows the linked list to maintain the order of elements.

The first node of a linked list is known as the head node. It serves as the starting point for traversing the list. The last node in the list points to a null reference, indicating the end of the list.

Linked lists offer several advantages and disadvantages compared to other data structures like arrays:

**Advantages:**
1. **Dynamic Size**: Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically, as memory is allocated or deallocated as needed.
2. **Insertion and Deletion**: Insertion and deletion operations can be performed efficiently, especially when adding or removing elements from the beginning or middle of the list.
3. **Memory Utilization**: Linked lists use memory efficiently as nodes are allocated dynamically and only as needed.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Sequential Access**: Unlike arrays, accessing elements in a linked list requires traversing the list from the beginning, which can be inefficient for large lists.
2. **Extra Memory Overhead**: Each node in a linked list requires additional memory for storing the reference to the next node, leading to higher memory overhead compared to arrays.
3. **No Random Access**: Linked lists do not support direct access to elements by index. Accessing a specific element requires traversing the list from the beginning.

Overall, linked lists are suitable for scenarios where dynamic size and efficient insertion/deletion operations are more important than random access or sequential access to elements. They are commonly used in implementations of various data structures and algorithms, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables.
