"DSA in C++" refers to the practice of implementing Data Structures and Algorithms using the C++ programming language. 

**Data Structures** are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.

**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They can be seen as a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the desired output. Examples of algorithms include sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort), searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search), traversal algorithms (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search), and many others.

In C++, you can implement data structures and algorithms in various ways:

1. **Using Standard Template Library (STL)**: C++ provides a rich set of data structures and algorithms in its Standard Template Library (STL), such as vectors, lists, stacks, queues, maps, sets, algorithms for sorting, searching, etc. These can be directly used in your programs by including relevant header files (`<vector>`, `<list>`, `<stack>`, `<queue>`, `<algorithm>`, etc.).

2. **Custom Implementations**: You can also implement data structures and algorithms from scratch according to your specific requirements. For example, you might implement a linked list, a binary search tree, or a sorting algorithm like quicksort.
